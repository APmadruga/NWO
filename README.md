# Gitbusters Charlie

This project was only possible because we worked great as a team(Andr√© Paulo, Guilherme Orlenas, Nelson Silva, Vitor Cordeiro ) and had fun while doing it.


We were able to implement our ideas, and seeing the final result really made us proud.

I was responsible for implementing the enemy detetion systems/logic, helped to associeated the images every moves of the game characters, also recorded voices for the game, and I was also responsible to create the java runable file using Ant.
